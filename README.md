Powerbi Project : The RO-KO effect :
 I’ve created an interactive Power BI report showcasing the incredible journeys of Rohit Sharma and Vira Kohli! The report dives into their performances across ODIs, T20s, and Tests, providing detailed insights like:
Runs Scored 💥
Hundreds 🔥
Innings Played 🏏
And much more...

📊 Features of the Report:
Slicer Options to filter by Match Type (ODI, T20, Test) and Opponent Country 🌏
Column Chart highlighting the top 5 opponent countries with the most runs scored 🏆
Pie Chart showing the top 5 countries against the most innings played 🔄
This is a great way to analyze how these two giants performed against different teams over the years! 📈
